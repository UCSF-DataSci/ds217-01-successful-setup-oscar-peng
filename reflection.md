# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
Hello! My name is Oscar Peng. I am a UCSF School of Dentistry DDS Candidate and an MS in Clinical and Epidemiological Research (Data Science Track) student. I am interesting in learning core data science and machine learning skills and applying them to the field of dentistry through clinical informatics and bioinformatics. I like hiking, and I am excited to learn as much as possible in this coming year.

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
I am hoping to set a strong foundation in coding and other computational skills while also building a strong theoretical foundation. In the future, after completing my DDS and my MS I aspire to go into residency working with oral cancer patients, and using the skills I gain here to branch into bioinformatics (maybe a PhD at one point, who knows)!

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I am excited about how much opportunity and interst there is in data science and AI, and I'm hoping to be a leader/researcher in the field as it pertains to detnistry and oral medicine.
